# Voice-Controlled Flappy Bird Using Scribbler.io

## Project Overview

This project is a voice-controlled version of the classic Flappy Bird game using **Scribbler.io**, a platform that allows for easy game development using JavaScript. Players will navigate through obstacles by quite literally shouting, providing a unique twist on the original game.

## Features

- **Voice Control**: Players can control the bird's movement using screams.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Randomly generated pipes that the bird must navigate through.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for each pipe they successfully pass.
- **New Game Dynamics**: Introduced roof and floor teleportation that simplify gameplay, making it easier for players to enjoy the game.(makes the game beatable lol)

## Technologies Used

- **Scribbler.io**: For hosting the game.
- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for game logic.
- **Web Speech API**: To enable voice recognition functionality.

- ## PS: It is currently PC only for now. Trust the notebook before using it for the voice control.
